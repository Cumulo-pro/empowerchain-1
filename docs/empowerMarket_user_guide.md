## Intro
Plastic credits are generated through the efforts of local plastic collectors who clean up specific areas and register the plastic with Empower. Once the plastic credits are created, the collectors can offer them for sale on the Empower portal. Empower reviews the documentation provided to approve the credits, which are allocated to the buyers. The buyer receives a certificate and completed documentation at the time of purchase.
